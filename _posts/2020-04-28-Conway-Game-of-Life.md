Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. This implementation is a tribute to him, since he passed away by Covid19 in April 2020. RIP John.
        
Let us denote the nodes as Coronavirus cases, with an objective of suppressing the number of Covid19 cases. After each iteration, some nodes die and some take birth.
