##Abstract

In this analysis, we have the data pertaining to individuals suffering from back pain. We have many clinical parameters that, in combination, determine the back pain type which is a binary outcome. We will use several classification techniques such as, logistic regression, classification trees, bagging, random forest, boosting and support vector machine to model the outcome.

In addition we form the training and test data by three approaches: splitting data into test and training data, bootstrapping and k-Fold cross validation. Once the models are built, we assess the performance using accuracy and the area under the ROC curve metrics. The goal is to identify which model performs the best in the given approach. We will also analyse which data splitting approaches are more reliable.
